### ApplyPass

# Charming HR execs around the world

ApplyPass allows users to apply to jobs automatically by pressing one button. Currently available for ZipRecruiter on Firefox. ApplyPass was initially an exercise in learning recursion, and has since become a real tool I have used to apply to jobs. I was kind of fed up with the entire world seemingly being automated, so ApplyPass has helped me to level the playing field a bit. 

Ideally, I'm looking for a team that will be genuinely interested in a problem solve such as this and who ideally won't be too peeved that I probably didn't see their post. Accepting that this is a tall order, ApplyPass has at least served to be a solid foundation in recursion in Javascript.

It is however a real tool that forms part of an anti-automation (automation) suite together with TableTurn, a program that detects automated emails and responds with an automated email.

Petty? Maybe. Awesome? Definitely.
